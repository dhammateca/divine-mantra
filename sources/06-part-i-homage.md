# Part I: Homage

> To pay respect to, and ask forgiveness of, the Buddha’s relics, relics of the Noble Disciples, Buddha images, stupas, the Bodhi tree—all of which are objects that all Buddhists should respect, both inwardly and outwardly:

*Arahaṁ sammā-sambuddho bhagavā.*  
The Blessed One is Worthy & Rightly Self-awakened.

*Buddhaṁ bhagavantaṁ abhivādemi.*
I bow down before the Awakened, Blessed One.

**(BOW DOWN)**

*Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo.*
The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One.

*Dhammaṁ namassāmi.*
I pay homage to the Dhamma.

**(BOW DOWN)**

*Supaṭipanno bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho.*
The Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples has practiced well.

*Saṅghaṁ namāmi.*
I pay respect to the Saṅgha.

**(BOW DOWN)**
