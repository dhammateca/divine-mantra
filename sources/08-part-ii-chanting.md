The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One,

*Sandiṭṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko,*  
to be seen here & now, timeless, inviting all to come & see,

pertinent, to be seen by the observant for themselves.

worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect,

*Anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassāti.*  
the incomparable field of merit for the world.

Through the power of the purity of the property, they are released from all pain, all danger, all disease.

*Iti uddham-adho tiriyaṁ sabbadhi sabbattatāya sabbāvantaṁ lokaṁ, mettā-karuṇā-muditā-upekkhā-sahagatena cetasā, catuddisaṁ pharitvā viharati,*  
When one dwells spreading an awareness imbued with good will, compassion, empathetic joy, & equanimity in this way to the four directions, above, below, around, in every way throughout the entire cosmos,

*Sukhaṁ supati, Sukhaṁ paṭibujjhati, Na pāpakaṁ supinaṁ passati,*  
one sleeps with ease, wakes with ease, dreams no evil dreams.
